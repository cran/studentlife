\description{
Download, navigate and analyse the Student-Life dataset.
The Student-Life dataset contains passive and automatic sensing data
from the phones of a class of 48 de-identified Dartmouth college students.
It was collected over a 10 week term. Additionally, the dataset contains
Ecological Momentary Assessment results along with pre- and post-study
mental health surveys, such as the PHQ-9. The intended use is to assess
mental health, academic performance and behavioral trends.
The raw dataset and additional information is
available at <https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/>.
