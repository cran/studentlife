\usage{
PAM_categorise(
  tab,
  pam_name = "picture_idx",
  types = c("quadrant", "valence", "arousal")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{A data.frame (or tibble) with a column representing
Photographic Affect Meter (PAM) score.}

\item{pam_name}{Character. The name of the column
representing PAM.}

\item{types}{Character vector containing the categories,
one or more of "quadrant", "valence" and "arousal" into
which to code PAM scores.}
}
\value{
The data.frame (or tibble) \code{tab} with extra columns
\code{pam_q}, \code{pam_v}, and \code{pam_a} for
quadrant, valence and arousal respectively.
}
\description{
Categorise Photographic Affect Meter (PAM) scores into
4 categories by either PAM Quadrant, Valence or Arousal
(or multiple of these).
}
\details{
The 4 Quadrant categories are as follows:
Quadrant 1: negative valence, low arousal.
Quadrant 2: negative valence, high arousal.
Quadrant 3: positive valence, low arousal.
Quadrant 4: positive valence, high arousal.

Valence and arousal are traditionally
scores from -2 to 2,
measuring displeasure to pleasure, and
state of activation respectively. However,
here we map those scores to positive numbers
so (-2,-1,1,2) -> (1,2,3,4).
