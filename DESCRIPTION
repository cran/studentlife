Description: Download, navigate and analyse the Student-Life dataset. 
    The Student-Life dataset contains passive and automatic sensing data 
    from the phones of a class of 48 Dartmouth college students. 
    It was collected over a 10 week term. Additionally, the dataset contains ecological 
    momentary assessment results along with pre-study and post-study mental  
    health surveys. The intended use is to assess 
    mental health, academic performance and behavioral trends. 
    The raw dataset and additional information is 
    available at <https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/>.
