This package is [available on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=studentlife).

Use this R package to download, navigate and analyse the Student-Life dataset. The Student-Life dataset contains 
    passive and automatic sensing data from the phones of a class 
    of 48 de-identified Dartmouth college students. It was collected 
    over a 10 week term. Additionally, the dataset contains Ecological 
    Momentary Assessment results along with pre- and post-study mental 
    health surveys, such as the PHQ-9. The intended use is to allow
    researchers and other interested people to assess 
    mental health, academic performance and behavioral trends. 
    The raw dataset and additional information is available at <https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/>.




Installation
------------

``` r
## Uncomment to install the package from CRAN
# install.packages("studentlife")

## Or, uncomment to install the package from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("frycast/studentlife")
```

This studentlife repository includes a small sample dataset that can be used for practice and testing. You can download the sample data within R:
```
library(studentlife)
d <- tempdir()
download_studentlife(location = d, url = "testdata")
```

This README will use the studentlife data in its original format. 
Details on the full original dataset are available [here](https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu).
However, an RData version of the dataset has been hosted on Zenodo as of 09/11/2019 [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3529253).
To download and use this RData version (which is faster to read and takes up less space):

```r
d <- tempdir()
download_studentlife(location = d, url = "rdata")

# Choose the schema and table from the list SL_tables:
SL_tables

# Example with activity table from sensing schema
schema <- "sensing"
table <- "activity"
act <- readRDS(paste0(d, "/dataset_rds/", schema, "/", table, ".Rds"))
act
```

In this README we will use the full dataset rather than just the sample data. The download size is 5 GB.

``` r
download_studentlife(location = d)
```

Use the interactive menu to browse the tables and schemas of the downloaded dataset:

``` r
tab <- studentlife::load_SL_tibble(location = d)
```

The object returned by the above function is called a
'StudentLife tibble' (or `SL_tbl`).
Restrictions can be placed on the menu options with `time_options`:

``` r
tab_t <- load_SL_tibble(location = d, time_options = "timestamp", csv_nrows = 10)
tab_p <- load_SL_tibble(location = d, time_options = "interval" , csv_nrows = 10)
tab_d <- load_SL_tibble(location = d, time_options = "dateonly" , csv_nrows = 10)
tab_s <- load_SL_tibble(location = d, time_options = "dateless" , csv_nrows = 10)
```

The `regularise_time` function can be used to summarise information within blocks of time,
producing an object called a 'regularised StudentLife tibble' (or `reg_SL_tbl`):

``` r
tab <- load_SL_tibble(
  loc = d, schema = "sensing", table = "activity", csv_nrows = 10)
  
regularise_time(
  tab, blocks = c("day","weekday"),
  act_inf = max(activity_inference), add_NAs = FALSE)
```

Produce a histogram showing PAM EMA response frequencies over the course of the study:

``` r
tab_PAM <- load_SL_tibble(schema = "EMA", table = "PAM", location = d)
response_hour_hist(tab_PAM, break_hours = 10)
```

![](man/figures/response_hour_histogram.png)

A summary will produce details such as EMA question, UIDs of 
dropped students, schema name, table name, and summary statistics.

```r
summary(tab_PAM)
```

```

After regularising a StudentLife tibble, we can visualise the 
missing values in each block for each student:

```r
reg_PAM <- regularise_time(tab_PAM, blocks = c("day", "epoch"), m = mean(picture_idx, na.rm = TRUE))
vis_NAs(reg_PAM, response = "m")
```
![](man/figures/vis_NAs.png)

We can also visualise and compare the total number of responses 
received from each student over the course of the study:

```r
vis_response_counts(reg_PAM, response = "m")
```

Summaries of survey data are formatted with question information and some answer statistics:

Software Testing
----------------

This studentlife repository includes many automated software tests implemented via [`testthat`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat). We use these to check for bugs before releasing new updates. They can be found under the directory `tests`. Also, we use [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/frycast/studentlife) for continuous integration.
